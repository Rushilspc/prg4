# Project: "Dopamine-Station" - A Gamified Maximalist Productivity Hub

## Role & Tech Stack
You are a Senior Frontend Architect and Creative Developer. 
Build a single-page React application using:
- **Framework:** React (Vite)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Focus on custom configurations for heavy design)
- **Animations:** Framer Motion (Mandatory for all interactions)
- **Icons:** Lucide-React
- **Persistence:** LocalStorage (for saving tasks/logs)
- **Fonts:** Import 'Space Grotesk' and 'Rubik Glitch' via Google Fonts.

## Design Philosophy: "Pop-Culture Maximalism"
**DO NOT make this minimal.** The design must be loud, funny, and heavy.
- **Aesthetic:** A mix of "Neo-Brutalism" (thick black borders, harsh shadows) and "Retro-Arcade" (neon colors, glitch effects).
- **Inspiration:** Think Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse meets Stranger Things (neon lights) meets Pixar (bouncy physics).
- **Color Palette:** High contrast. Hot Pink (#FF00FF), Lime Green (#32CD32), Electric Blue (#00FFFF), and Deep Void Black.
- **Vibe:** The UI should feel "alive." Buttons should bounce when clicked. Cards should tilt on hover. Backgrounds should have moving patterns (grid lines or particles).

## Core Features (Functional Requirements)

### 1. The "Time Machine" (Work Logger)
- A section to log completed work.
- Fields: Task Name, Duration (Hours/Minutes), Category (e.g., "Grind", "Deep Work", "Admin").
- **Gamification:** When a task is added, trigger a confetti explosion or a "Level Up" sound effect/visual.

### 2. The "Power Meter" (Hours Calculator)
- A prominent, animated dashboard showing:
  - **Daily Total:** Progress bar filling up as users log hours.
  - **Weekly Total:** A heavy graphic (like a health bar) showing hours worked vs. goal.
- Logic: Sum up logs based on the current date and the current ISO week.

### 3. The "Mission Board" (Task Planning)
- A Kanban-style or List-style view for daily routines.
- Items should look like "Quest Cards" from an RPG game.
- Functionality: Add, Edit, Delete, Mark Complete.

## UI/UX Layout & Animation Specs
1.  **Hero Section:** A massive, animated greeting (e.g., "Welcome to the Chaos, Master"). Text should use glitch effects.
2.  **Navigation:** A floating dock at the bottom (macOS style but cartoonish) with bouncing icons.
3.  **Transitions:**
    - Use `AnimatePresence` for smooth entry/exit of task items.
    - Stagger animations for lists (items appear one by one).
4.  **Micro-interactions:**
    - Hovering over cards should scale them up (scale: 1.05).
    - Clicking buttons should squash them (scale: 0.95).
    - Custom Cursor: A large, colorful custom cursor that reacts to clicking.

## Code Structure Constraints
- Ensure the `HoursContext` handles all math logic for daily/weekly calculations accurately.
- Use distinct Components: `TimeTracker.jsx`, `StatsDashboard.jsx`, `TaskBoard.jsx`.
- Ensure the app is fully responsive but prioritizes desktop "dashboard" feel.

**Goal:** Create a productivity tool that feels like a video game interface. It should be fun, chaotic, and functional.
