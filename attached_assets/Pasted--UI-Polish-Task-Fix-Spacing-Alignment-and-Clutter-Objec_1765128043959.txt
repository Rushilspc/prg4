# UI Polish Task: Fix Spacing, Alignment, and Clutter

## Objective
The current layout is too cluttered. The components are squashed together, and the alignment is messy.
**DO NOT change the color theme (keep the "Sunny/Watercolor" style).**
**ONLY fix the layout, spacing, and component structure.**

## Layout Rules (Strict Implementation)

### 1. The Container (Fixing the Width)
- Wrap the entire application in a centered container with a maximum width.
- Use: `max-w-5xl mx-auto px-6 py-12`.
- This ensures the website doesn't stretch infinitely on wide screens.

### 2. Vertical Rhythm (Breathing Room)
- Increase the gap between main sections. Use `gap-12` (3rem) or `space-y-12`.
- Inside the cards (Journal, Progress, Task Board), double the padding. Change `p-4` to `p-8`.

### 3. Grid Alignment (Fixing the "Messy" Columns)
- **Desktop View:** Use a 12-column grid.
  - "Journal Entry" (Time Machine): Span 7 columns (`col-span-7`).
  - "Your Progress" (Power Meter): Span 5 columns (`col-span-5`).
- Ensure both cards have the **exact same height**. Use `h-full` on the cards and `items-stretch` on the grid container so they align perfectly at the bottom.

### 4. Input Field Cleanup (The "Journal" Section)
- The "Hours" and "Minutes" inputs look messy.
- **Fix:** Put them in a single row using `flex gap-4`.
- Make the input boxes distinct: Give them a white background `bg-white`, a subtle shadow `shadow-sm`, and a proper height (`h-12`).
- Align labels *above* the inputs, not floating randomly.

### 5. Typography Fixes
- The main title "Ready to create something beautiful?" is too large. Reduce text size to `text-4xl` or `text-5xl`.
- Section Headers (e.g., "Journal Entry"): Make them smaller (`text-2xl`) but bolder.

## Visual Polish Code Instructions
- Add `backdrop-blur-sm` to the cards to make them feel like frosted glass or high-quality paper.
- Center the "Navigation/Footer" icons at the very bottom of the screen with plenty of whitespace above them (`mt-20`).

**Action:** Rewrite the layout code (App.jsx / Main Components) to apply these spacing and grid rules immediately.
